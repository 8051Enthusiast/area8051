//! Module for finding the base address of a misaligned 8051 firmware

/// Finds the base address of a misaligned 8051 firmware image.
///
/// This works by counting how many times an address is the target
/// of an lcall/ljmp (acall/ajmp too if acall is enabled) and cross-
/// correlating that with the addresses that are after ret instructions
/// This cross-correlation is equivalent to counting, for each possible
/// base address of the firmware, how many jump destinations are after
/// a ret instruction. For the right base address, this should be the
/// highest since often, new functions start after a return and jumps
/// go there.
///
/// In the naive way, calculating this would take 2^32 multiplies and
/// additions, since for each of the 2^16 base offsets, one would need
/// to multiply each value in the return array with the corresponding
/// value in the target address array, but luckily cross-correlation
/// can be done by cleverly using a FFT, so this is actually quite fast
///
/// For acall/ajmp, the target address is marked as if in the current block
/// and in the next block, since the block depends on the instruction's
/// address and cross-correlation couldn't be used, so this tradeoff is done
/// for speed.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `buf` - Contents of the firmware file
/// * `acall` - whether to include acall/ajmp in the calculation (this
/// can introduce a lot of noise)
